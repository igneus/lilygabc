Render gabc scores in LilyPond, by a single LilyPond command,
no converter script involved.

Mostly useless toy project.

    GABC is a description language for chant that supports an extension towards adiastematic neumes (NABC) but does not support polyphony or length stems - yet. Chant described in GABC can be displayed by any software that supports it.
    ...
    Gregobase has twenty thousand entries, Neumz has about half that, all in GABC, and Repertorium has trained optical music recognition software using GABC as training data, which means the contents of thousands of manuscripts may soon become available as GABC.
    Is GABC ideal? No, for many reasons, one of the biggest, as evidenced by this thread, being that it does not play nicely with polyphony and/or modern notation.
    ...
    An alternative to GABC is a score description language with the ability to represent chant, polyphony and modern notation - and if the creator of this language has one teaspoon of wisdom, they will make it so existing GABC can be effortlessly and reliably converted into that more powerful description language.
